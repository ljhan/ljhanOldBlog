My most ambitious drawing yet!  Scrolling through <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/lissiichan/drawing/" target="_blank">Pinterest</a> for drawing inspiration, I came across <a href="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/8b/b4/16/8bb4165c187d7066e9245ecf6c69d32c.jpg" target="_blank">this gorgeous mermaid</a>.  Even though this drawing is way beyond my skills (especially after taking such a long break from drawing welp), I really wanted to at least attempt recreating it.  I was pleasantly surprised with the result :)  Well, aside from the wobbly, overworked inking D:

I first practiced by tracing it, then experimenting with some colors on a print out, then recreating it from scratch in my sketchbook.
