title: Updates to my site: WHO and WHERE
---

Just pushed some fresh new pages onto my site!  I finished the <a href="http://ljhan.com/who.html" target="_blank">WHO</a> and <a href="http://ljhan.com/where.html" target="_blank">WHERE</a> pages first since I had the clearest visions for those.  Had a lot of fun adding fun but cohesive hover effects for WHO.  Currently, it feels just a bit sparse, but I'll leave it for now.  The amazing <a href="https://www.iconfinder.com/iconsets/miu-hexagon-flat-social" target="_blank">hexagonal icons</a> are a nice change of pace from your typical circles.  Meanwhile, it was very interesting playing around with <a href="https://mapbuildr.com/" target="_blank">Map Buildr</a> to create a custom Google Map featuring my most meaningful places.  

I still have quite a list of features and pages I want to add (and hopefully much improved responsiveness...); hopefully I can crank them out by the time school starts again.
