My first drawing, let alone Copic marker drawing, in months.  I was very inspired by Mateusz Urbanowicz's lovely and brilliant <a href="http://mateuszurbanowicz.com/tokyo-storefront-illustration-series" target="_blank">"Tokyo Storefront" watercolor illustrations</a>.  I can't wait to bring my new gouache paints to campus!  My illustration is influenced by the exterior of this <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/513621532493975324/" target="_blank">glasses boutique</a> in Taiwan. 

Concept sketch (great for planning out the form)
