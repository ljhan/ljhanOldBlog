Heylo, and welcome!  So, you're probably wondering... _ljhan_?  What could these five random letters possibly mean?  Let me introduce myself and get some basic facts and stats out there: my name is **Alyssa Liu** and at the time this post is being written I'm a rising juinior at **Northwestern University**, where I study **computer science, linguistics, and design**.  I am fascinated by the magic and the humanity of technology just as much as I love expressing myself creatively.  Here, I want to let my thoughts and ideas roam freely, and share my projects and challenges with you, dear reader.  Thanks for coming along for the ride c:

Long story short, _ljhan_ is me - 劉錦涵 (liu2 jin3 han2, my Chinese name)/Alyssa Nichole Liu, and this site is where stories meet, _from me to you_.
