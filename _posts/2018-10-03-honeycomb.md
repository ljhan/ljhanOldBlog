For Design Thinking Doing, an introductory design course, my team practiced iterative user-centered design to design a set of adaptable study space furniture: the Honeycomb table and the Honeycomb study pod. Just as our furniture pieces fit together, throughout the project, I was fitting my team members together, like a honeycomb.

**Role:** researcher and designer

**Skills:** design thinking, research, industrial design, branding design

Observations of existing study spaces, expert interviews, surveys, and prototyping, and user testing were the driving forces of our project. We split the early research evenly, and I played a role in developing the project idea and managing the execution of our vision. We were all very passionate about improving Northwesternâ€™s study spaces, making for final concepts we are proud of.

A key challenge was providing structure to my diverse and sometimes divergent team. Instead of focusing on our differences, we harnessed our individual strengths to deliver two solid design concepts for gallery walks and reviews. With the many deliverables required for the class, a high level of organization and foresight was needed.

I learned from working on Honeycomb that working on a specialized team with diverse skillsets can be a very rich learning experience. Our final product also benefits from each of our different contributions, making it better than anything we could have created individually.
