As mentioned in the previous post, I spent an afternoon in Coffee Lab, a local coffee shop not far from campus.  It's been a rough time, and I definitely needed an afternoon to myself to recharge and be motivated again.  I spent a couple hours in this cozy spot sipping on their famous white mocha and snacking on their delectable honey cinnamon bread (more like toast).  I attempted to draw this afternoon snack haha (it's a bit sloppy.. oops, it happens)

Highlight of this day:  I left around an hour and a half till closing, and a barista kindly gave me a slice of that delicious honey bread bagged free of charge :3  Must've made extra I suppose, but it was such a kind gesture and really helped me through that day.
