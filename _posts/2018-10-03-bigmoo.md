For my submission to Wildhacks Hackathon 2016, I made a visual experience for interfacing with music loops. Using A-Frame, I created an immersive galaxy with interactive shapes that play samples. I created my first VR experience for Google Cardboard, learned how to express my creativity with code, and practiced working with a partner to deliver a product in a time-sensitive environment.

**Role:** Front-end developer

**Skills:** A-Frame, WebVR, Google Cardboard

Drawing on my interests in VR and music, I developed a vision for a “galaxy” where users experiment with 3D objects linked to music loops. I brought on a partner to help develop the experience. We had a rare opportunity to be truly free in expressing ourselves through code and wanted to share something whimsical and interactive with other hackathon attendees.

Creating a working product within 36 hours using an unfamiliar framework was a unique challenge. We were able to navigate A-Frame to create this novel experience. Our next biggest challenge was building an interesting, immediately learnable virtual “world.” Setting manageable checkpoint goals early on and developing our project in incremental stages was key to our success.

With the opportunity to combine my different passions for music and technology, this was the most enjoyable and creative hackathon project I have worked on to date. I now feel empowered and excited to create more VR experiences.
