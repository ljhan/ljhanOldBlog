Found a lovely inspiration on <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/513621532486019502/" target="_blank">Pinterest</a> and thought I'd give it a go!  A couple new techniques I'm loving: using Prismacolor erasable coloring pencil in rose for the penciling and connecting the inked lineart with dots (which give it a wonderful, playful quality).
