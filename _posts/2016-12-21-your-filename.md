I am very excited to share that I was recently featured by <a href="https://medium.com/@ReigningIt" target="_blank">ReigningIt</a> as one of a "woman who reigns"!  They aim "to create a STEM dialogue inclusive of every woman's background, life experience and beliefs" and "help redefine what it means to be a woman in tech, as this now encompasses so many facets."  In this series of Medium posts, they are highlighting many women in tech (many are students!).
