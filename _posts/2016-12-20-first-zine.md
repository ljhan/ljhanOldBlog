Recently (through <a href="http://bubblesort-zines.myshopify.com/" target="_blank">Bubblesort zines</a> and listening to podcasts) I discovered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zine" target="_blank">zines</a> - a fun and snappy medium for sharing your own content â€“ essentially mini magazines.  I love the pocket-friendly size and creative liberty you have with zines, and they are historically associated with experimental subcultures.  The organic, hands-on process of making your own limited batch of publications is very gratifying.

One weekend partway through fall quarter, I wanted to just take a break (especially having just returned from Grace Hopper), so I took a stab at making graphics with Sketch (don't judge me) to digitally make a zine, in hopes of making physical copies using <a href="http://www.rookiemag.com/2012/05/how-to-make-a-zine/" target="_blank">this tutorial</a>.

I was a bit at a draw for topics, so I stuck with something close to heart: habits I am currently forming. I worked primarily with my beloved pastel rainbow color scheme and incorporated a lot of gradients and clean, simple geometric shapes.  Numbering the pages helped with folding it all together in the end, as well as created a distinct ranking for these habits.
