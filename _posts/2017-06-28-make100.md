After a busy year exploring new technologies (creating WebVR experiences, modeling voxels, making pixel game art...) I want to spend my flexible summer simply making things.  While my previous 100 day drawing challenge left me feeling confined to that single medium, I'm excited to be productive across a wide variety of mediums and technologies, including:

- web development
- WebVR using A-Frame
- pixel art/animations
- interaction design
- vector art
- Arduino
- 3D modeling and printing
- voxels
- drawing/sketching
- painting
- zines
- graphic design
- bots

Specific applications/software/sources of inspiration:

- Sketch (especially unconventional uses for it)
- Principle 
- Photoshop
- Codepen (forks!)
- Codrops
- Glitch

On the topic of getting things done this summer…

Tutorials/educational sites I’d like to continue exploring:

- What the Flexbox?
- JavaScript 30
- Hack this Site
- Exercism
- Design Your Life
- more terminal stuff
- industrial design sketching

Now that summer is in full swing and my routines are gradually solidifying, I’m excited to be my most productive self this summer!  Hope you enjoy joining me as I attempt to #make100
