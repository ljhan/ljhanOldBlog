Always, always, always matcha is (one of) my favorite flavor(s) for sweets!!  I love tea in general, but I've always had such a soft spot for matcha (抹茶/maccha/mo3cha2), with its delicate sweetness and soft, earthy bitterness.  Oftentimes I'll see delicious photos of matcha sundaes/parfaits from <a href="http://tsujiri-global.com/menu.html" target="_blank">Tsujiri</a> on Tumblr or Instagram, so I decided to make a drawing inspired by their namesake sundae!  I actually drew this sitting in Coffee Lab on a recharging afternoon.
